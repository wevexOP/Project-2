            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Dominic Paulazzo and I am an aspiring software engineer/developer based in Northern California. As a recent graduate of San Francisco State University where I majored in English literture, I have since found a passion for computer science and the immersive innovative culture that surrounds it. When I am not working you can find me online gaming or out in the ocean ripping some waves. Winter is appraoching too so maybe I will see you on a ski lift in Tahoe! Check my "Connect With Me" section to view my social accounts and contact info.

            <h2> My Work Portfolio </h2>
            <p>
                Throught my working life I have had many jobs in all types of industrys. Begining at a very young age I started working at German automotive repair shop, then working in some construction, some outdoor fruinitrue sales to making pizzas at an Italian restaraunt, and then recently working in the insurance industry as a webdeveloper. Right now I work at the same automotive repair shop that I began my working career at but now I handle customer service, scheduleing, and manage the social media accounts for the business. Moving forard, I would like to add software development to my proud list of careers.
